# intuition #

Python/Twisted library for receiving multicast UDP (local) messages from the Network Owl (OWL Intution) home energy monitor.

This library does not interface with the Owl Intuition website, and requires that it be run on the same LAN segment as the Network Owl.  It has been tested primarily with the OWL Intuition-lc.
